A principal funcionalidade deste código é a manipulação de arquivos do tipo string, semelhante ao HTML.

## What were implemented

Menu:

> - Features such as add to bag, favorite were implemented to give a real experience of saving products on the platform.
> - Those features store data in local storage to prevent the user from losing their products if something happens.
> - When something is added to a bag or favorite, it shows a popup to make it easier for the user to know what's happening.
> - On the bag and favorite pages, it shows a button to remove items from them
> - I implemented a carousel to show the products on the home page, to give a better experience.
